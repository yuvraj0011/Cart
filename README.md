# Cart
I developed "Cart" as a practice project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive mobile app design. The project features a user-friendly shopping cart interface with smooth navigation, dynamic item addition/removal, and responsive elements, ensuring optimal display and functionality on various screen sizes.
